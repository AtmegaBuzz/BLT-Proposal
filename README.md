# About Me

I'm currently pursuing a BE (bachelor of engineering) in Computer Science at Savitribai Phule Pune University in India.
I started learning Python programming in my first year of college and later started learning backend programming and became familiar with frameworks like Flask and Django, Along with studying front-end programming using JavaScript libraries such as React, Next, and React-Native. I have expertise unit testing Python code using pytest and Selenium and enjoy learning about backend programming, cyber security, and low level system concepts. Additionally, I worked as the MLH Fellowship's prep fellow, where I and the other fellows learned the basics of contributing to open source.


# ABOUT ME & WHY I CHOSE THIS PROJECT

Ever since I began learning computer science, open source has been a huge source of passion for me.
I've always wanted to give back to the community, and by participating in GSOC, I'll gain exposure to opensource projects that are ready for use in the industry and receive mentoring on how to write software with clean code and use design paradigms and patterns from mentors with a lot of experience in open source. They can help me along the way and advance my opensource journey by pointing me in the correct direction.

I'm choosing Owasp for a particular reason. The majority of the tools I used when I first began learning about cybersecurity ZAP, Top 10, etc were from OWASP, and OWASP Top 10 helped me understand and learn about the top 10 web vulnerabilities.
The advancement of cybersecurity technologies, in my opinion, is also essential for helping businesses secure their networks. The importance of information security has increased considerably in recent years.
I believe that by making a contribution to OWASP, I will be able to contribute to this crucial area, which many people are unaware of and lack access to.

I choose BLT Project because I like the overall idea of reporting bug's found on the internet and anyone could report it by tagging the organizations which will be incentivized.
Also BLT aligns with my Stack i.e Django, Javascript, Blockchain.I also have a bit of understanding in blockchain (Bitcoin-core) and this project will help me improve my skills on stack listed above.

# **Project Details**

# Overview

In this project. My aim is to make the BLT project production ready with no major bugs. Below I've listed all the features and changes I will be implementing in the project.

The project is divided into 3 sections.

- BLT frontend.

    - Fixing all bugs and integrating new design given in figma design using Tailwind CSS.
    - Polishing the frontend and solving all frontend related issues.

- BLT backend.

    - Closing 30% of open issues
    - Implementing proof of stake coin
    - Integration of API rate limiter
    - Create and document apis for all functionality implemented on the web to support flutter apps.
    - Implement a bug verification system to verify if a bug is valid.
    - Company Dashboard using tailwind and Private Issue reporting

Also the **proposed duration of the project is 350hrs.**



# **Implementation**

## BLT Frontend

Current BLT website has a lot of bugs and the UI implemented is not polished. As mentioned in the issue [New Design #696](https://github.com/OWASP/BLT/issues/696).
I'll be implementing the new design's using Tailwind CSS.

- ## Home Page

    - Current home page does not contain a leaderboard for Top company, Top Testers and Recent Bugs.
    - Adding the most popular bug section. In this section users can easily find the most trending bug and this will be filtered by the amount of likes and comments in the Bug from the backend.

![](RackMultipart20230228-1-uz2bl9_html_2b54a5cd90e91f7d.png)

- ## Start Bug Hunt Page

    - Old start bug hunt page does not look so polished. Creating a new Bug hunt page with polished UI and background.

![](RackMultipart20230228-1-uz2bl9_html_2ec630c2fb283a07.png)

- ## User Profile Page

    - Adding a new profile page with stats showing info of bug reported likes and comments, category of bug solved ( Typo,Security,etc ) with all the recent activities by the user.

![](RackMultipart20230228-1-uz2bl9_html_eb116013132838b7.png)

- ## Company Dashboard Page

    - After registering the Company, the User will become admin of that domain and company. Users will see all their registered company in a user's company page and will be directly able to manage all the companies and add multiple users to manage the company and domain.

![](RackMultipart20230228-1-uz2bl9_html_edee97dbd21dd292.png)


## BLT Backend

Backend part will be implemented in the following steps:

- Closing 90% of backend related issues.
- APIs
  - Create APIs of all functionality on BLT web for BLT Flutter
  - Create tests for the APIs
  - Document the APIs using postman
  - Integrate API rate limiter
- Implementing proof of stake coin.
- Implementing Private Issue reporting and a Voting System just like Stack overflow



- ## API's for BLT Flutter

    - Currently most of the functionality is implemented on the web interface but mobile is the key device which increases the accessibility of the BLT project so implementing all the functionality which are on the BLT web to BLT flutter will increase the accessibility.
      - Pagination on all the list APIs

    - **Documentation and Testing (**[Django's Unit Test](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest)**)**
      - Providing good documentation makes it easy for contributors, consumers and maintainers to understand the functionality and maintain the project in the long run.
      - Creating tests is a key part in maintaining the project. It will help maintainers catch any bug's early before deploying the project to production.

    - **API Rate Limiter:**
      - To protect our backend from abuse, integrating an API rate limiter is an essential part. This will help in limiting the API calls per user. Thus protecting the Backend from bot's and scripts trying to access BLT data.
      - Best tool which fits the case is Django-Rest-Frameworks [API Throttling](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/throttling/)
      - Image given below gives a better understanding of how Django REST API Throttling works.

![](RackMultipart20230228-1-uz2bl9_html_d12253e5f7a14e64.png)

- ## Proof of Stake Coin (BUG Coin)

    - Giving rewards to bug hunters/reporters will boost their morale and give them motivation to participate more in Bug Hunting programs.
      - The plan is to integrate [Bitcoin-POS](https://github.com/BitcoinP0S/bitcoinpos) which works on Proof of Stake consensus algorithm to avoid the power consumption as compared to Proof Of Work (PoW) consensus.
      - **Reason** behind implementing our own chain is to make faster transactions and we will be the governing Authority.
      - This coin can be integrated with future ideas of exchanging the coins with merch or discounts in our premium programs.
      - Implementing 2 coins (**BACON** and **BUG**) over our independent blockchain.

## ![](RackMultipart20230228-1-uz2bl9_html_dc36a28e85afc4dc.png)

- ## Private Issue Reporting

    - Some bug's can be crucial and cannot be displayed in public.
    - Allow companies to launch a private bug hunting program in which all the bugs reported by the hunters will be private by default and only the company which the program belongs to can see those bugs/vulnerabilities found.
    - Allow users to tag an organization to make the bug/issue found private and only accessible by the organization/company

![](RackMultipart20230228-1-uz2bl9_html_533f81e63e10293a.png)


- ## Issue Voting System

    - The Plan is to implement a voting system on bugs published
    - The voting functionality will be same as of stackoverflow
    - User's can vote on a bug if they have at least
      - 1 Verified issue/bug
      - Participated in at least 2 bug hunts
      - More to be included during implementation

# Availability

- I will be able to work full-time (a minimum of 40 hours a week) in May.
- I have exams in June, but I'm targeting a minimum commitment of 25hrs a week.
- I have no obligations in July and August so I'll be able to work for a minimum of 40 hours per week

# Why me?

Being a very enthusiastic individual in the CyberSec and open source fields, I enjoy learning about technology regardless of how difficult or simple its design is to implement.

I have a good foundation in integrating Full Stack solutions and I have almost 2 years experience with frameworks like Django, Flask, and React. I am also skilled at developing and implementing APIs.
 I also have a basic understanding of blockchain concepts and mainnets including bitcoin, ethereum and solana.

# After GSoC

I believe that once my GSOC is completed, I will know the codebase like the back of my hand and be comfortable making significant improvements to the project.

I will therefore contribute to OWASP BLT and other OWASP projects and attempt to put new ideas into practice.

If possible I will also try to maintain BLT and increase community engagement of BLT by posting about bugheist on socials.
